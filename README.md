\- MySQL or other database (data storage)

\- Flask or another web framework

\- HTML/CSS (frontend)

\- Git \& GitHub (version control)







## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core business logic, APIs, and server-side functionality. Ensures that data flows correctly between the database and the frontend.

### 2. Frontend Developer
Focuses on designing and developing the user interface. Works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database schema, ensures data integrity, sets up queries, and optimizes database performance for the application.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Handles version control, deployment pipelines, and automates infrastructure using CI/CD tools. Ensures smooth integration and continuous delivery.

### 5. Project Manager
Coordinates the team’s efforts, sets deadlines, assigns responsibilities, and ensures the project stays on track.

### 6. QA Engineer (Tester)
Tests the application thoroughly to catch bugs and ensure quality standards are met before any release.




## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build backend logic and system functionality.

- **Git**: Version control tool used to manage source code changes across the team.

- **GitHub**: Hosts the code repository and facilitates collaboration via pull requests and issues.

- **Docker** (optional, if mentioned): Used to containerize the application for easier development and deployment across environments.

- **CI/CD Tools** (e.g., GitHub Actions): Automate testing, building, and deploying of the application.



## Database Design

### 1. Users
- **id**: unique identifier
- **name**: full name of the user
- **email**: user’s email address
- **password_hash**: securely stored password
- **role**: host or guest

### 2. Properties
- **id**: unique property ID
- **owner_id**: reference to the user (host)
- **title**: property title
- **location**: address or city
- **price_per_night**: rental cost

### 3. Bookings
- **id**: unique booking ID
- **user_id**: the guest who made the booking
- **property_id**: the property being booked
- **start_date**: check-in date
- **end_date**: check-out date

### 4. Reviews
- **id**: unique review ID
- **booking_id**: related booking
- **user_id**: who left the review
- **rating**: numerical score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- **comment**: optional text feedback

### 5. Payments
- **id**: unique payment ID
- **booking_id**: the booking being paid for
- **amount**: total payment amount
- **payment_method**: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- **status**: success, pending, failed


## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature includes authentication and role-based access (e.g., host or guest) to ensure secure use of the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, including descriptions, photos, location, and pricing. This feature enables property owners to manage their offerings directly from the platform.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It includes booking validation, availability checks, and links to payment processing.

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and star ratings after a stay. This helps build trust in the platform and improves the visibility of high-quality listings.

### 5. Payment Integration
Handles secure payments through various methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal). Ensures both host and guest transactions are completed and recorded safely.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by location, price, availability, and other filters. This makes it easier to find relevant listings quickly.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (Optional)
Admins can monitor system activity, manage users or listings, and enforce platform rules. Useful for maintaining quality and handling reported content.



## API Security

To ensure the integrity and safety of our backend APIs, we will implement the following key security measures:

### 1. Authentication
Users must prove their identity before accessing secure endpoints. We will use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to validate sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
Once authenticated, users can only perform actions allowed by their role (e.g., host vs. guest). This prevents users from accessing or modifying data that doesn’t belong to them.

### 3. Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, we will limit the number of requests a user can make in a short time window.

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All inputs will be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Sanitizing user input protects the application from harmful payloads.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
All data will be transmitted over HTTPS to ensure that sensitive data (like passwords and payment info) is encrypted in transit.



### Why API Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data**: Personal and payment information must be safeguarded to build trust and comply with data protection laws.
- **Securing Transactions**: Payment processing must be secure to avoid fraud and financial loss.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access**: Ensures that users can only access their own data and actions.
- **Maintaining Platform Integrity**: Stops bots, spammers, and attackers from disrupting the system.



## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a process that automates building, testing, and deploying code every time a change is made, ensuring faster and safer releases.

By integrating CI/CD pipelines into the project, we reduce manual work, catch bugs early, and ensure code quality with consistent deployment practices.



### Tools for CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying directly from GitHub.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application, making it portable and consistent across environments.
- **Docker Hub**: Used to store and share Docker images for deployment.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS / Railway** (optional): Hosting services that support automated deployments from CI/CD pipelines.
